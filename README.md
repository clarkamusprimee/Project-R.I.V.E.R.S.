# Project-Rivers

AS A working civilian
I WANT to keep track of my scheduled events
SO THAT I can stay organized and alerted

Criteria
GIVEN A calendar template
WHEN I click on a date
THEN Im presented with a pop up to list events

Group project number 1 was definitly a challenge for us. Our confindence with APIs wasn't its best and we werent quite sure how to implement more than just the moment.js, the holiday API was one of our main issues. Next main issue is properly sizing the input table. Being able to make the calendar and the table work together was our major success in this project and we are happy we got this part of the project to work properly. 

This project really put us into perspective as to how far behind we actually are. Myself - Elias, have been behind in modules probably since the portfolio challenge we did those many weeks ago and havnt caught up since. The team work we have isnt the problem in this case as we are all good friends, personally its the lack of knowledge I have in javascript that most likely weighed us down in this project.
